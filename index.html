              would be unfair to just ask of you, so I will also share my goals
              when making this workshop: - giving everyone some language,
              context, and questions to help make known some part of their
              unknown - inspire personal growth if interested - leave with more
              tools to protect yourself from those who may cause harm (including
              yourself)
